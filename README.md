# Linear-Data-Structures
A java program where the user can choose one of the following data structures and perform its basic operation.

### The program are as follows: 

MAIN MENU
When the program starts, a main menu is displayed providing 5 options to the user:
  1. Stack
  2. Queue
  3. Linked List
  4. Circular Linked List
  5. Exit
The user can select a data structure that they wanted to perform and its operation, or they can exit the program if they want.

STACK OPERATIONS

- It follows the LIFO principle
  
Push - it adds a new element on top of the stack

Pop - removes the top element

Display - display all the elements

Exit Stack operations - exit the stack operations back to the main menu

QUEUE OPERATIONS

-It also follows the FIFO principle.

Enqueue - adds a new element at the end 

Dequeue - removes the element at the front

Display - prints all the elements 

Exit Queue operations - exit the queue operations back to the main menu


LINKED LIST OPERATIONS 
-It uses Java's built-in LinkedList class.

Insert at the end - adds a new element at the end of the linked list

Delete at the beginning - removes the first element

Display - prints all the elements in the linked list 

Exit linked list operations - exit the linked list operations back to the main menu


CIRCULAR LINKED LIST OPERATION

- It is a custom implemeentation where the last node points back to the head node.
  
- Made using two classes 'Noded' and 'CircularLinkedList'
  
  insert - adds a new node at the end

  delete - removes the first node
  
  display - prints all the nodes
  
  exit circular linked list operation - exit the operation back to the main menu
